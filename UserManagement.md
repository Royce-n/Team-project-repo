# User Management Project

## Purpose
This project manages user accounts and their access levels.  
Admins can add, edit, deactivate, or reactivate users.  
Regular users can sign in and view their profiles.

## Roles
- **BasicUser** – default role for normal users  
- **Admin** – can add, edit, or deactivate accounts  
- **Manager** – can view and manage team information  

## Deactivation
When an account is deactivated, the user cannot sign in until an admin reactivates it.

## Team Members
See contributors.md for full list.

## Deliverables
- Working user management system  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Deactivated users blocked from login
